Having been involved with the Social Service Council at my university for over two years, I am confident that this opinion is grounded on my perception of the paradox in reality. I state explicitly that selfless work is selfish; for it seeks inner-peace and social validation. Maybe not intentionally, but that's what it result in and that's what many hope for. No matter how astute you are, your neanderthal biological machinery would always be driven towards such positive results subconciously. 

Now that we have established this, comes the actual substance of the argument  - how do you gauge these selfish nuances? If no act can ever be truly selfless, because it would reward your psyche in someway, should your efforts hold less value? Or is it that because acting out of kindness is a stimuli to your limbic system, you are better than those who are driven by chocolates? 

No matter what your answer is, the reality remains that a small act from your part can change someone else's life forever. 

That's what we try to do at Kashi Utkarsh, we hope to make something good out of our day by sharing our knowledge and resources with those in need. And one step at a time, we make a difference, in our lives and in theirs.
